    <h1>FAQs</h1>

    <div class="card">

      <h2>What is this, exactly?</h2>
      <p class="lede">
        A young snake plant, intentionally unfinished.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Soul Baby is not a finished houseplant. It is a beginning.
        What arrives is a few cured snake plant leaves, soil, and a small dose of seaweed tonic — designed to grow slowly,
        with very little demand on you.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not about productivity or perfection. It’s about returning, occasionally,
        to something living and forgiving.
      </p>

      <h2>How do I begin the ritual?</h2>
      <p class="lede">
       You don’t need to meditate or follow a strict routine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sit near a window. Notice the light. Place one hand on the pot or glass. Take three slow breaths before you do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ritual isn’t about duration, it’s about returning. A few mindful moments, repeated over time, are enough.
      </p>

      <h2>Why begin this way?</h2>
      <p class="lede">
       Because there is something quietly grounding about watching life grow from something small.
      </p>
      <p>
        A single cutting becomes roots, then new leaves — and over time, a living presence in your home. Snake plants are long-lived, resilient, and known for gently improving indoor air quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beginning with less invites patience. It gives you time to notice change, rather than rush toward it. What grows isn’t just a plant, but a sense of care, continuity, and attention.
      </p>

      <h2>What’s included in the box?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cured snake plant leaf cuttings (prepared by hand)</li>
        <li>Approximately 250g of charcoal-mixed succulent soil</li>
        <li>1 small vial of organic seaweed tonic (monthly dose)</li>
        <li>A QR card linking to the Ritual page and guidance</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="fine">
        No plastic pots, no printed instructions, no excess. Just what’s needed.
      </p>

<h2>What if my pot is larger than the soil provided?</h2>
<p>
If your pot is larger than the amount of soil included, that’s okay.
</p>
<p>
Add a drainage layer to the bottom of the pot first — this helps prevent excess moisture
and protects the cutting while it roots.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Horticultural grit or coarse sand</li>
  <li>Small stones or gravel</li>
  <li>Clay pebbles (LECA), if you have them</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once the base layer is in place, add the Soulful Plant soil on top and plant the cutting.
Do not mix the layers.
</p>

<p class="fine">
Snake plants prefer dryness and air around their roots.
This simple layering helps recreate those conditions.

      <h2>What is a snake plant?</h2>
      <p>
        Snake plants (Sansevieria) are resilient, slow-growing plants known for their ability to tolerate neglect.
        They store water in their leaves, prefer dry soil, and grow steadily rather than quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are one of the few houseplants that release oxygen at night, making them well suited to bedrooms
        and quiet spaces.
      </p>

      <h2>What are the benefits?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Low-maintenance, low-anxiety care</li>
        <li>Improved indoor air quality over time</li>
        <li>A visual reminder to slow down</li>
        <li>A living object that benefits from patience, not control</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How long does it take to grow?</h2>
      <p>
        Growth is slow by design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roots typically form within a few weeks to a few months, depending on whether you choose water or soil.
        New growth (pups) usually begins to appear between <strong>7–9 months</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="fine">
        There is no failure if nothing appears quickly. Snake plants work on their own time.
      </p>

      <h2>How do I care for it?</h2>
      <p>
        You have two options when your cutting arrives:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> Place the cut end into a glass of water, submerged just above the cut. Change the water weekly until roots form.</li>
        <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Plant directly into dry soil. Water lightly, then leave it alone.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Both methods work. Choose the one that feels right.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>What is the ritual?</h2>
      <p class="lede">
        Ritual ≠ duration. Ritual = repetition with meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ritual is not a task. It’s a pause.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a day, week, or month — sit with your plant for a few minutes.
        Notice your breath. Notice the leaf. Touch the soil or glass.
        There is nothing to fix and nothing to optimise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The plant grows slowly. You’re allowed to as well.
      </p>

      <h2>Is this a subscription?</h2>
      <p>
        No. This is a single object with an ongoing relationship.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
      <p>
        Anyone who wants something living without pressure.
        Anyone who struggles to keep plants alive.
        Anyone who wants a quiet way to practice care.
      </p>

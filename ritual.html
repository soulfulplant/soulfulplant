        This plant does not respond to urgency. It grows quietly, out of sight, before it rewards you.
      </p>

      <h2>Before you plant</h2>
      <p>
        If you want, place the cutting somewhere visible for one day.
        Let it become familiar before you ask anything of it.
      </p>

      <h2>Planting</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fill a small pot with the soil provided (or any fast-draining succulent soil).</li>
        <li>Make a small hole and place the cutting in the soil.</li>
        <li>Press the soil gently so it can stand. Don’t pack it hard.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Watering</h2>
      <p>
        Use very little water. For the first watering, a small splash is enough.
        After that, only water when the soil is fully dry.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        If you forget to water it, it will forgive you.<br>
        If you water it too often, it won’t.
      </p>

      <h2>Light (UK seasons)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Summer:</strong> bright, indirect light. Keep away from harsh direct sun.</li>
        <li><strong>Winter:</strong> place near a window or windowsill for maximum daylight.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What to expect</h2>
      <p>
        Roots form quietly, out of sight. You may see nothing for weeks — that is normal.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Weeks 1–4: nothing obvious is fine.</li>
        <li>Weeks 4–8: gentle resistance when you tug can indicate rooting.</li>
        <li>Later: new growth appears when it’s ready, not when you check.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Seaweed tonic</h2>
      <p>
        Once a month, add a tiny amount of tonic to your watering.
        More is not better. Small is enough.
      </p>

      <h2>If something feels “wrong”</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Soft or mushy base:</strong> too much water. Let the soil dry completely and reduce watering.</li>
        <li><strong>No visible change:</strong> often just low winter light. Move it closer to a window and wait.</li>
        <li><strong>Dry edge:</strong> normal. This is a plant that prefers being left alone.</li>
      </ul>

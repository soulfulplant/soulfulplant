      <p>
        Your Soul Baby arrives unfinished on purpose.
        There may be no roots. No visible progress. No signal that anything is happening.
        This is not a mistake. It is the correct starting point.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Growth begins out of sight.
        This ritual exists to help you trust that.
      </p>

      <h2>Before you begin</h2>
      <p>
        Choose a moment that feels unhurried.
        You don’t need a routine — just a pause.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Set aside 5–10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring your Soul Baby, soil, and water nearby.</li>
        <li>Soften the space if you like — open a window, lower the light, or sit quietly.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="fine">
        There is no correct setup. Intention matters more than environment.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Your two paths</h2>

      <p>
        From your testing and ours, both of the following approaches work.
        Choose the one that feels right to you.
      </p>

      <p class="fine">
        There is no “better” choice — only different rhythms.
      </p>

      <h2>Option 1: Water first (slower, more observable)</h2>

      <p>
        This option allows roots to form in water before planting.
        It is ideal if you prefer to see progress over time.
      </p>

      <h3>How to begin</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Place the leaf in a clean jug or glass.</li>
        <li>Submerge only the bottom cut — do not cover the leaf.</li>
        <li>Use fresh water. Spring water is ideal, but clean tap water is fine.</li>
        <li>Change the water when it becomes cloudy, or at least once a week.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What to expect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Weeks 1–3: likely no visible change.</li>
        <li>Weeks 4–6: small roots may begin to appear.</li>
        <li>Later: roots strengthen and lengthen.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="note">
        Stillness is part of the process. Absence of change is not failure.
      </p>

      <h3>When to plant</h3>
      <p>
        Once roots are visible and feel established, you may move the leaf into soil.
        This does not need to be rushed.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Option 2: Soil first (simpler, quieter)</h2>

      <p>
        This option places the leaf directly into soil.
        It requires less attention and suits those who prefer to set something in motion and step back.
      </p>

      <h3>How to begin</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fill a small pot with the charcoal succulent soil provided.</li>
        <li>Make a shallow hole and place the cut end into the soil.</li>
        <li>Gently support the leaf — do not pack the soil tightly.</li>
        <li>Add a very small amount of water.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What to expect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Weeks 1–4: no visible change is normal.</li>
        <li>Weeks 4–8: roots form beneath the surface.</li>
        <li>Later: new growth may appear when conditions are right.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="note">
        If you forget about it for a while, it will forgive you.
        Too much attention is more risky than too little.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Light & placement (UK guidance)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spring & Summer:</strong> bright, indirect light. Avoid harsh direct sun.</li>
        <li><strong>Autumn & Winter:</strong> place closer to a window or windowsill for daylight.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="fine">
        Snake plants prefer dry soil and light-filled spaces.
        Bathrooms and damp corners are a common myth.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Monthly care</h2>
      <p>
        Once a month, you may add a small amount of seaweed tonic to your watering.
        More is not better. A little is enough.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>If something feels wrong</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Soft or mushy base:</strong> too much water. Let it dry completely.</li>
        <li><strong>No change for weeks:</strong> normal, especially in winter.</li>
        <li><strong>Dry edges:</strong> common and not harmful.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="note">
        This plant grows on its own timeline.
        Your role is to allow, not to manage.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Closing the ritual</h2>
      <p>
        Take one slow breath in. One breath out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank the plant.
        Thank yourself.
      </p>
